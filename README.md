- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlgorithmesAndCo
- 👀 I’m interested in dangerous animals (Python), dangerous activities (dancing the Tango), and I find it fun
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a ton of things, but no I won't tell you what or you'll have to pay me a drink!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on one main big computer project, and I'll be paid for it this time!
- 📫 How to reach me: just get in touch with me using GitHub, that's fine, and it's a good start!
